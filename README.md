# YOLOv8-SLAM
This Repo is the code of my undergraduate thesis. The method of Dynamic SLAM system is largely inspired by [MonoRec SLAM](https://github.com/silvery107/monorec-slam).

In this project, my method mainly focus on:
- Alleviate the tracking algorithm from using matches that belong to dynamic objects, in most cases achieving a higher accuracy in evaluation;
